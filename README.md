# Hi there, I'm [Your Name]! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3D modeler with a passion for coding and a background in computer science. I enjoy exploring the intersection between art and technology, creating visually stunning experiences through both 3D modeling and programming.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and exploring new techniques in both 3D modeling and software development, always eager to expand my skill set and tackle exciting challenges.

ðŸ’» As a computer science graduate, I have a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development principles. I love applying this knowledge to create efficient and elegant solutions to problems, whether it's writing code or optimizing 3D models.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects that combine my interests in 3D modeling and coding, ranging from interactive visualizations to game development.

ðŸš€ Some of my recent projects include:
- [Project 1](https://github.com/meryzennn/Bank-Sampah): Brief description of the project.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via [email](mailto:me.ryzennn@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryz-en-605562259).

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Indonesia and I love exploring Indonesian culture and cuisine in my free time!

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together! ðŸ˜Š
